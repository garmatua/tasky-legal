# Tasky Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** February 5, 2026

## Our Privacy Commitment

Tasky is designed with your privacy as the top priority. We believe your tasks and personal data should stay yours—not ours.

## Data Collection & Storage

### What We DON'T Collect

- ❌ We do NOT store your tasks on our servers
- ❌ We do NOT require an account
- ❌ We do NOT track your personal information
- ❌ We do NOT sell your data to third parties
- ❌ We do NOT access your task content

### What Stays on Your Device

All your task data is stored **locally on your iPhone** using:
- Local storage on your device
- App Group containers (for widget access)

Your data NEVER leaves your device except in these specific cases:
1. When YOU explicitly export it
2. If you enable iCloud backup (controlled by iOS, not Tasky)

## Third-Party Services

We use the following third-party services to improve the app:

### 1. Google AdMob (Advertising)

**Purpose:** Display ads to support free app development

**Data Collected by AdMob:**
- Device identifiers (Advertising ID/IDFA)
- IP address
- Device type and operating system
- App usage data
- Ad interaction data

**Your Control:**
- You can limit ad tracking in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Tracking → Limit Ad Tracking
- You can reset your Advertising ID in iOS Settings → Privacy & Security → Apple Advertising

**AdMob Privacy Policy:** https://policies.google.com/privacy

### 2. Firebase Crashlytics (Crash Reporting)

**Purpose:** Detect and fix app crashes to improve stability

**Data Collected:**
- Crash logs and stack traces
- Device model and OS version
- Time of crash
- Anonymous app usage data
- **DOES NOT include your task content**

**Firebase Privacy Policy:** https://firebase.google.com/support/privacy

## Widgets & App Groups

Tasky uses iOS App Groups to share data between the main app and widgets.
- **Purpose:** Allow widgets to display your tasks
- **Scope:** Data shared ONLY between Tasky app and Tasky widgets on YOUR device
- **Privacy:** No external access—stays on your device

## iCloud Backup (iOS System Feature)

If you enable iCloud Backup on your iPhone:
- iOS may back up your Tasky data to your personal iCloud account
- This is controlled by iOS settings, not by Tasky
- Only YOU can access your iCloud backup
- We (Tasky developers) have NO access to your iCloud data

**To disable backup for Tasky:**
1. Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups
2. Select your device → Show All Apps
3. Toggle off "Tasky"

## Data Export & Deletion

### Export Your Data

You can export ALL your data at any time:
1. Open Tasky
2. Go to Settings (⚙️)
3. Tap "Export Data"
4. Your data downloads as a JSON file

### Delete Your Data

To permanently delete all your data:
1. Delete the Tasky app from your iPhone
2. All local data is immediately and permanently deleted

**Note:** If you exported your data, the export file remains wherever you saved it.
